# 🚀 1% Better - Daily Log of a Creative Dev
One month ago I decided to learn Creative Web Development, transitioning from a [10+ yrs career in 3D and VFX](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm10480418/).<br>
- **This is a minimalist daily log designed to track that journey, from beginning to infinite.** <br>
- It's a compassionate, constant reminder that getting [1% better everyday](https://jamesclear.com/continuous-improvement) matters.
- It was inspired by [this video](https://youtu.be/YKkJwBzBYSk?si=WukU4o1ESfslJhUw) and the [learning in public manifesto](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) .
